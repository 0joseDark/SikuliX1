SikuliX IDE
===

Implements a GUI using Java, that allows to edit and run Sikuli scripts (currently Jython and JRuby are supported). It is an easy to use IDE focusing on the handling of the screenshots and images used in the typical Sikuli workflows.

The ready-to-use package after a `clean install` is `sikulixide-x.x.x-complete.jar` in the traget folder.

It can be used on commandline to run scripts or to open interactive scripting sessions.
